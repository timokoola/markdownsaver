Chrome browser plugin to create markdown link for a current page

## What does it do?

It is an extremely simple chrome browser extension to copy the URL of the current tab and its title as a markdown link. It doesn't do much but it does that!

## How do I install it?

If you want to use it before it will be available otherwise, first clone this repository, then go to [Extensions](chrome://extensions/) and enable developer mode. And finally click "Load unpacked" and navigate to directory you cloned the repository in.


## Can I change it?

Sure.

## Can you...?

Within reason yes, just create an issue here or email me.
